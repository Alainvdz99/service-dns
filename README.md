# docker-dns-discovery
Docker Service Discovery using docker-gen and dnsmasq

docker-gen generates a configuration for Dnsmasq and reloads it when containers are
started and stopped.

This is a fork of [dns-gen](https://github.com/jderusse/docker-dns-gen) 
refactored to work with the Alpine Linux base image.

See [dns-gen](https://github.com/jderusse/docker-dns-gen) repo for detailed instructions.
